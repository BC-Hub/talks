# Dynamic (Web)Site Generators

**The Biggies** (PHP Rules!)

- WordPress
- Drupal
- Joomla!

On your live production site requires

- database (e.g. mysql)
- application server (e.g. mod_php)
- web server (e.g. apache)

On every request - (re)builds the page on-the-fly e.g. queries the database, runs scripts,
merges templates, etc.



# Static (Web)Site Generators / Builders

On your live production site requires

- web server (e.g. apache, ngnix, etc.) only

- **NO** database needed
- **NO** application server needed

Note: You can even go "server-less" e.g.
host your site on a web service e.g. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).

You build the complete site, that is, **all pages** "ahead-of-time"
on a "build" machine. You will end-up with a bunch of (static) ready-to-use
HTML, CSS and JS files (*). Upload to production site and you're live
w/ a kind of "super cache".

(*) and media files e.g. graphics, music recordings, etc.


# Static (Web)Site Generators / Builders

2. Microsoft FrontPage
3. Netscape Composer

And today?
