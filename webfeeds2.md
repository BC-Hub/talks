title: Meet Jason Feed - The New Web Feed & Syndication Guy



# The Future of Online News - The Future of Facebook & Co

- How do you read your news?
  - On your computer?
  - On your mobile phone?
  - In your browser?
  - In an app?

- How many websites do you read?
  - One (just Facebook ;-) or Krone)
  - Two or three
  - More than ten
  - More than a hundred



# What's a Web Feed?

<img src='i/web-feed-icon.png' style='float: right;'>

A web feed (or news feed) is a (simple) document/text format
that:

(1) lets you publish a list of:

- status updates, blog postings, articles, pictures, cartoons, recordings, etc.

and that

(2) lets others subscribe to your updates.

# Meet Jason Feed - A New Feed Format in JSON - feed.json (Cont.)

Use `content_text` for text

```
"content_text": "JSON Feed? I know that guy.",
```

and `content_html` for hypertext.

No artificial intelligence (AI) needed ;-)



# Meet Jason Feed - A New Feed Format in JSON - feed.json (Cont.)

Bonus: Use `summary` for summaries

and `content_text` or `content_html` for full content.

Note: "Full" content might just be:

```
"content_text": "Me!"
```


# Why JSON? Why not XML?

JSON is the new XML ;-)  Easier. Free. Simpler.

# Bonus: JSON Feed - Who's Who - Meet Brent Simmons n Manton Reece

Brent Simmons? - I know this guy!

Manton Reece? - I know that guy!

Brent Simmons built the NetNewsWire  more than 10+ years ago;
was first (most popular) news reader for Apple Mac OS X.

Blogs at [inessential.com](http://inessential.com)
with [feed.json](http://inessential.com/feed.json) ;-)


Manton Reece builds micro.blog - a timeline and publishing platform for the open web.
Also built the WordPress JSON Feed plugin ;-)

Blogs at [manton.org](http://manton.org) with [feed.json](http://manton.org/feed/json) ;-)



# Bonus: Let's "fix" JSON - What's wrong or missing in JSON 1.0?

- Add comments.
- Allow object keys without quotes.
- Add multi-line strings.
- Allow trailing commas or make commas optional.
- And much much more.

New (working) JSON format proposals include:

- [SON (Simple Object Notation)](https://github.com/aleksandergurin/simple-object-notation)
- [HJSON (Human JSON)](http://hjson.org)
- [JSON5](http://json5.org)
- and others

Why not evolve JSON? Keep it frozen, forever, really?

SON Feed? JSON5 Feed? HJSON Feed? Anyone?


# Bonus: What's Feed.TXT?

Feeds in Plain Text w/ Structured Meta Data @ GitHub [/feedtxt](https://feedtxt.github.io)

- Meta Data in (Simplified) YAML or Classic or Mordern JSON.
- Content in Plain Text with Markdown Formatting Conventions.

Example: Yes, the world's 1st podcasting feed in plain text ;-) Let's try.
